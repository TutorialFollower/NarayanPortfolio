# Three JS Portfolio

**Version: 1.0.0**

A website I made with Three JS and inspiration from the JS mastery portfolio. It uses React, Three.js, and tailwind css.
It has mobile support and fits on all screens and has a dynamic contact form that uses EmailJS to send and receive emails.
Uses framer motion to animate items like the timeline and the cards which also use react tilt.
